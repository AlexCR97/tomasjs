## 1. Getting started

### 1.1 Installation

Create a node.js express project and run the following command:

```
npm install tomasjs
```

### 1.2 Your first TomasJS app

Create the following file:

```typescript
import "reflect-metadata";
import { AppBuilder } from "tomasjs/builder";
import { AnonymousEndpoint } from "tomasjs/endpoints";

const PORT = 3000;

async function main() {
  console.log("Creating a TomasJS app...");

  const app = new AppBuilder().useEndpoint(
    new AnonymousEndpoint("get", "/", () => {
      return "Hello, TomasJS!";
    })
  );

  await app.buildAsync(PORT);

  console.log("TomasJS app is running!");
}

main();
```

Now run the file.

You should be able to reach your app at http://localhost:3000. The following content should be displayed in your browser

```
Hello, TomasJS!
```

Congratulations! You just created for first TomasJS app!
